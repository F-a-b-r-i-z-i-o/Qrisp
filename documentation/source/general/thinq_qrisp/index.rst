Quantum computers are associated with the hope of achieving enormous leaps in computing power. However, only a few people have been able to use them to date, as their programming poses entirely new challenges.  In addition, the limited number of developers in the field has made effective collaboration difficult.

This will change with the Thinq Qrisp Community!
------------------------------------------------

The community will offer a platform where developers can work on new ideas for programming quantum computers. Newly developed technologies will be quickly integrated into the open-source project Qrisp. The Thinq Qrisp Community is the central meeting place for all those who want to engage in quantum and pull it from the realm of abstract science into application oriented software development. For this we want to bundle and network the activities of the quantum software engineering community.

**The Thinq Qrisp community will facilitate exchange between industry, academia and newcomers!**
